		<h2>About</h2>
			<img src="./img/donmiesle.jpg" alt="Image of Don Miesle">
		<p>I take problems from identification to solution, by improving existing software or developing new software, creating processes and procedures, and making the tools or process as efficient as possible. From infrastructure to development, I provide results that exceed expectations.</p>
		<p>I have expert level proficiency in EnCase, FTK, Packet Capture, Log analysis, MacOS X, iOS, Forensic Techniques, database administration, database development, scripting, and encryption. I continue to expand my knowledge base by learning full stack software development.</p>

		<h2>Biography</h2>

		<p>I started my professional career working for a Member of Congress maintaining a mixed network with sites in Washington, DC and California including development new computer solutions. Additonally, I handled legislative issues including telecommunications, international relations, science, and defense issues, providing me with an in-depth understanding of Federal policy and laws. While it was interesting and challenging work, my passion for computer technology and how it can improve the lives and work of the people who are using it. That's when I started looking for a new challenge.</p>

		<p>I went back to school at George Washington University, and while maintaining a full time job I obtained a Master of Forensic Sciences, focused in High Tech Investigations. This provided me a depth of knowledge in file systems, networking protocols, and the methods to recover and extract information from a miriad of digital sources. This education, and working for the Software Engeering Institute, and CERT-Coordination Center, lead me to Apple, where my skills and problem solving grew and were applied in new and differnt areas.</p>

		<p>While at Apple, I've held two different titles but have been the primarily responsible person for managing and developing solutions to ever changing technology picture. Some of the highlights of projects I've been responsible for include data collections, knowldege management, eDiscovery productions, source code review deployment, evidence room management, mobile device collections, criminal court testimony, data warehouse deployments, and translation between engineers, lawyers, and law enforcement agents. Through this work I wanted to build better than what were commercially available. The best way to do that was to learn how to write my own software.</p>

		<p>Right now, I'm working full time and attending to WeCan{Code}IT flex bootcamp, where with independent work and every other weekend code jams I'm learning Java, Spring MVC, ahd full stack software development. Could you use someone with this background to solve your problems? Hit me up and we can start our conversation.</p>

				<p>You are looking at it. I've developed this site to provide a landing place for people like you, to see a brief synopsis of <a href="#about">who I am</a>,  <a href="#projects">what I've done</a>, and <a href="#contact">how to contact me</a>. I've used HTML5 and CSS (including Grid, and objects). Future development will probably include use of Java, Java Scripting, JPA, and something special sprinkled in.</p>

				<p>Create a console based game to allow user to create and maintain a virtual pet shelter where the user had to care for the pets to keep them alive. This project expanded my knowledge base to include Arrays, Collections, and refine object oreinted coding. I particularly enjoyed taking 20 lines of code from a previous project and reducing it to 3 lines.</p>

				<div id="project-3d">
				<p>This was my first forray into creating an interactive console based Java application. Some of the core functionalities are that the user is permitted to enter pretty much any information in response to any of the questions. The largest problem I had to solve from my perspective was creating a way to normalize whatever the user entereed for their birth mont (ie March or 3). Discovering and resolving the functionality of java.time.Month accessor got me over that hurdle.</p>
